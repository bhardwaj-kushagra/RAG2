    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.",
    "contexts": [
      "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.",
      "The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming, using data and algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions."

    "question": "What are neural networks?",
    "answer": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information using connectionist approaches to computation.",
    "contexts": [
      "Neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An artificial neural network is a large number of simple units, the neurons, organized into layers.",
      "A neural network consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows through the network, with each node processing inputs and passing outputs to the next layer."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "Neural networks are computational systems modeled after the brain's biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected artificial neurons organized in layers that process information."

    "question": "What is RAG in NLP?",
    "answer": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines retrieval systems with generative AI models. It first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and then uses those documents as context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.",
    "contexts": [
      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on.",
      "RAG combines two components: a retrieval system that fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base, and a generation model that uses these documents as context to produce responses. This helps ground the model's outputs in specific, retrieved information."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines information retrieval with text generation, where relevant documents are first retrieved from a knowledge base and then used as context for a language model to generate accurate, grounded responses."
